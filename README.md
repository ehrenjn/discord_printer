# discord_printer
A simple discord bot for sending images to my brother's printer via email  
The original idea was to fax him images but he didn't have access to a phone line  
The bot prints any images that are sent on a channel called "noid-pipeline"  
The bot resizes the images before emailing them so that every printed image covers the same amount of paper  
My brother's printer's email address, my email address/password, and the bot's discord token have been removed from the code
